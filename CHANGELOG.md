- The record editor form for place records now includes fields from the NAGPRA place extension, added in CollectionSpace 7.1.

## v5.0.0

v5.0.0 adds support for CollectionSpace 7.0.

### Breaking Changes

- The record editor form for object records now uses the `nagpraReportFiledGroupList/nagpraReportFiledGroup` repeating group, added in CollectionSpace 7.0.

  The following fields, present in CollectionSpace prior to 7.0, have been removed from the form:

  To use this version of the anthropology profile with an older CollectionSpace server, the above fields must be added back to the form.

- Added the Named Collection field to the Object record editor form (only if using cspace-ui version 5).

If you have customized this label using the previous message ID (`field.collectionobjects_nagpra.graveAssocCodes.name`), update your configuration to use the new ID. The previous ID contained a typo.

## v3.0.0

v3.0.0 adds support for CollectionSpace 6.0.

### Breaking Changes
